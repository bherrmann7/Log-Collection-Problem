Problem statement:

A customer has asked you for a way to provide on-demand monitoring of various unix-based
servers without having to log into each individual machine and opening up the log files found in
/var/log. The customer has asked for the ability to issue a REST request to a machine in order
to retrieve logs from /var/log on the machine receiving the REST request.

Acceptance criteria:

1. A README file describing how to run and use the service.
2. An HTTP REST API exposing at least one endpoint that can return the lines requested
   from a given log file.
3. The lines returned must be presented with the newest log events first. It is safe to
   assume that log files will be written with newest events at the end of the file.
4. The REST API should support additional query parameters which include
   a. The ability to specify a filename within /var/log
   b. The ability to specify the last n number of entries to retrieve within the log
   c. The ability to filter results based on basic text/keyword matches
5. The service should work and be reasonable performant when requesting files of >1GB
6. Minimize the number of external dependencies in the business logic code path. For
   example, if implementing your project with Node.js:
   a. Feel free to use Express or similar as the HTTP server as well as any of the
   built-in Node.js modules like fs.b. Please do not use external libraries for any file reads or working with the log
   lines after youâ€™ve read them. We want to see your solution in this case using only
   what Node.js has built-in.
